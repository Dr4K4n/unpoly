Navigation bars
===============

Unpoly automatically marks up link elements with classes indicating that
they are currently loading (class `up-active`) or linking
to the current location (class `up-current`).

This dramatically improves the perceived speed of your user interface
by providing instant feedback for user interactions.

@class up.navigation
###
up.navigation = (($) ->

  u = up.util

  ###*
  Sets default options for this module.

  @property up.navigation.config
  @param {Number} [config.currentClasses]
    An array of classes to set on [links that point the current location](/up-current).

    classes = config.currentClasses
    classes = classes.concat(['up-current'])
    classes = u.uniq(classes)
    classes.join(' ')

  SELECTOR_SECTION = 'a, [up-href]'

  normalizeUrl = (url) ->
    u.normalizeUrl(url) if u.isPresent(url)

  sectionUrls = ($section) ->

      if value = u.presentAttr($section, attr)
        values = if attr == 'up-alias' then value.split(' ') else [value]
        for url in values

  ###*
  @function findClickArea
  @param {String|Element|jQuery} elementOrSelector
  @param {Boolean} options.enlarge
    If `true`, tries to find a containing link that has expanded the link's click area.
    If we find one, we prefer to mark the larger area as active.
  @internal
  ###
  findClickArea = (elementOrSelector, options) ->
    $area = $(elementOrSelector)
    options = u.options(options, enlarge: false)
    if options.enlarge
      u.presence($area.parent(SELECTOR_SECTION)) || $area
    else
      $area

  ###*
  Links that are currently loading are assigned the `up-active`
  class automatically. Style `.up-active` in your CSS to improve the
  perceived responsiveness of your user interface.

  The `up-active` class will be removed as soon as another
  page fragment is added or updated through Unpoly.

  \#\#\#\# Example

  We have a link:

      <a href="/foo" up-follow>Foo</a>

  The user clicks on the link. While the request is loading,
  the link has the `up-active` class:

      <a href="/foo" up-follow class="up-active">Foo</a>

  Once the link destination has loaded and rendered, the `up-active` class
  is removed and the [`up-current`](/up-current) class is added:

      <a href="/foo" up-follow class="up-current">Foo</a>

  @selector .up-active
  @stable
  ###
  markActive = (elementOrSelector, options) ->
    $element = findClickArea(elementOrSelector, options)
    $element.addClass(CLASS_ACTIVE)

  unmarkActive = (elementOrSelector, options) ->
    $element = findClickArea(elementOrSelector, options)
    $element.removeClass(CLASS_ACTIVE)

  withActiveMark = (elementOrSelector, args...) ->
    block = args.pop()
    options = u.options(args.pop())
    $element = $(elementOrSelector)
    markActive($element, options)
    promise = block()
    if u.isPromise(promise)
      promise.always -> unmarkActive($element, options)
    else
      up.warn('Expected block to return a promise, but got %o', promise)
    promise

  ###*
  Links that point to the current location are assigned
  the `up-current` class automatically.

  The use case for this is navigation bars:

      <nav>
        <a href="/foo">Foo</a>
        <a href="/bar">Bar</a>
      </nav>

  If the browser location changes to `/foo`, the markup changes to this:

      <nav>
        <a href="/foo" class="up-current">Foo</a>
        <a href="/bar">Bar</a>
      </nav>

  \#\#\#\# What's considered to be "current"?

  The current location is considered to be either:

  - the URL displayed in the browser window's location bar
  - the source URL of a currently opened [modal dialog](/up.modal)
  - the source URL of a currently opened [popup overlay](/up.popup)

  A link matches the current location (and is marked as `.up-current`) if it matches either:

  - the link's `href` attribute
  - the link's [`up-href`](#turn-any-element-into-a-link) attribute
  - a space-separated list of URLs in the link's `up-alias` attribute

  \#\#\#\# Matching URL by prefix

  You can mark a link as `.up-current` whenever the current URL matches a prefix.
  To do so, end the `up-alias` attribute in an asterisk (`*`).

  For instance, the following link is highlighted for both `/reports` and `/reports/123`:

      <a href="/reports" up-alias="/reports/*">Reports</a>

  @selector .up-current
